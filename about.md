## About Us

My name is Aidan Grosz. I am currently a Senior at the University of Florida, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. It didn't take me long to realize I wasn't like my classmates, as instead of following the herd to join lackluster clubs or participate in "AI" research, I wanted to pursue my passion. This aforementioned passion was to help my fellow brothers and sisters in the art of car repair. I figured instead of selfishly keeping all my engineering knowledge to myself, I would provide it to my peers in the form of mechanical work. I specialize in both mechanical and electrical motorcycle repairs, and unlike the company name would suggest, I also service/repair cars. I can assure you my service is much better then what a dealership can provide, and for a much fairer price as I don't have to divert your labor dollars to unessecary corporate departments. Overall, the Scoot Doctor's goal is to save you time and money while also providing service to get you back on the road!
